                <h3>Hi there! I'm Trenton, a tinkerer by nature.
                    Since I was kid, I've always been passionate about trying to figure out how things work.
                    With a strong interest in computing. The first web page I wrote was a book report in 5th grade,
                    presented to class on a burnt CD - the good ol' days.
                    </br>
                    I went to University of Iowa for Informatics, after graduating, I couldn't stop thinking about a
                    Computer Human Interaction (WIMP Stack) corse I took. I was so enveloped how so many different gears
                    worked together to present something so seamless.
                    </br>
                    That class made a strong shift in my interest from Data Science to Web Dev that I've been pursuing
                    since.

                    I love and encourage teamwork, learning is fundamental to any position, what better way than from
                    collaboration. I’m always looking to learn something new, even if it doesn’t pertain to what I’m
                    currently doing. I think looking at new trends, languages, and work flows only adds to your arsenal.
                    Providing new ways to approach current problems.
                    </br>
                    Not knowing something is just opportunity to learn, and helping someone fill in knowledge gaps is
                    super rewarding!
                    </br>
                    I tend to energize the workspace around me and I'm a strong communicator, and not afraid to use it
                    either!

                    I’ve spent the last 2 years of my professional life putting these skills to work fixing software and
                    hardware problems at the user level, but now I’d like to use them to create the software and fix the
                    problems upstream instead.

                    The purpose of this project was to help understand timing & jQuery by creating two challenges.
                    First, only displaying one question at a time. Second, providing the user with a set amount of time,
                    for each question, to answer.
